#### **Intro** <a href="#intro" id="intro"> **\#** </a>

A year has passed since my last post on this blog. For a while, I didn't have anything new to discuss as I wasn't actively working on any new or exciting projects. However, at the end of January 2023 I began working at a small startup as a Junior Frontend Developer. It was, due to a number of reasons I will not delve into, a shortlived experience with me leaving the job near the end of April. Since it was my first ever tech job, I want to discuss my experience and the lessons I learned.

#### **Background** <a href="#background" id="background"> **\#** </a>

The company I worked at is called Intelligence22, a small data-management startup which hosts its own data-management platform to measure business and performance metrics for its numerous clients. The dev team at the time consisted of five people, myself included: two backend developers, two data engineers, and myself. I was hired as the sole frontend developer (despite having no prior experience!).

I had a number of tasks to perform which ranged from making the data platform responsive on all devices, wireframing and developing UI components, and fixing bugs. The frontend consisted of a mixture of Vue, HTML, and Blade files. Having no prior experience with Vue, I spent a couple weeks training and familiarising myself with it before I began actively contributing to the team. Given that I had prior React experience, it didn't take too long before I was using Vue in my daily tasks.

Overall, despite the fact that it was a short stint, I would describe it as a positive learning experience -- most notably, I gained self-confidence as a developer. I proved to myself that, as a self-taught developer used to working alone, I am capable of handling my own tasks while still working as part of a team. In addition, I left having gained a better understanding of the sort of demands placed on a developer in the corporate world.

#### **Lessons** <a href="#lessons" id="lessons"> **\#** </a>

##### **Communicate needs and progress**  <a href="#communicate-needs" id="#communicate-needs"> # </a>

This probably goes without saying, but it is something which I only began practising a few weeks after I began developing Vue components and making changes to the UI. As a self-taught developer, I was used to working independently, which meant that I was getting my tasks done but I wasn't necessarily communicating how I was getting along. It was after a meeting with the project manager that I began documenting my daily tasks, my progress, any issues I was having, and when I expected to complete them. Not only did this help my colleagues, it also helped me manage my tasks better and plan my time more effectively.

##### **Don't demand too much from yourself**  <a href="#demands" id="#demands"> # </a>

As mentioned earlier, this was my first job working as a developer. As a result, I subconsciously placed unneeded pressure on myself. I expected myself to power through the Vue training as quickly as I could so that I could begin contributing sooner. Also, despite reassurance from colleagues that my work was of a good quality, I still had nagging doubts. However, looking back on it, I realise that I was doing just fine. If I could go back, I would tell myself to relax a little because the learning process is a slow one and there will always be things you don't know.  

##### **Know what you want**  <a href="#know-what-you-want" id="#know-what-you-want"> # </a>

This is something which I could only learn after having gained some experience in the field. Prior to accepting the job at Intelligence22, I was happy to accept whatever offer came my way. I didn't give much thought to whether I would like to work in a startup or an established company. However, after my experience in my first frontend role, I now have greater clarity with regards to what I expect from my next workplace. For example, I am decided that I will only work for an established company with a sizeable dev team, or at least one which has a senior frontend developer whom I can learn and benefit from. At this moment in my journey, it is not beneficial nor sensible for me to accept a job role where I am the sole frontend developer of a company -- the pressure is not something I am willing to shoulder the burden of nor is such a job role conducive to my growth as a developer.

#### **Conclusion** <a href="#conclusion" id="conclusion"> **\#** </a>

Overall, it was a positive first experience working as a junior frontend developer. I left the role not just with greater experience and confidence as a developer but also as a professional. I know what to expect from future job roles and I also know what expectations I have. I can confidently acknowledge that I am better prepared for future frontend developer roles now than I was prior to this experience.
