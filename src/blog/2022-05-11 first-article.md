#### Intro

First of, I'd like to welcome you to my personal blog page where I'll be posting updates about my ongoing projects and ideas I have for the future. This site is officially my first completed project which I have uploaded to the Internet. Although I have created mini projects in the past, I haven't showcased them anywhere. Part of the reason why is because I didn't have anywhere to show them off, so I decided I would create a portfolio which would serve a couple purposes:

1. It would allow me to showcase my work
2. It would allow recruiters or potential employers to take a look at my completed projects as evidence of my abilities.

So I decided to crack on with it and build my portfolio. I got around to completing 90% of it, but then realised I didn't actually have any projects to put on it. This then lead to me racking my brain for project ideas when I finally settled on making my own blog. I thought that it would be a piece of cake and I wouldn't learn much from it, but I was very wrong. Let me share with you my experience making my personal blog website and my very first published piece of work.

#### What went well 

I generally suck at acknowleding my strengths and giving myself credit where its due, so I will try my best to give an honest reflection of what I think I did well. To start off with, I actually saw this project through till the end. There have been times in the past where I have lost interest in a project midway through, never to return to it again. The fact that this is the biggest project I have worked on and I did not lose track is a big accomplishment. To be honest, completing this blog website has given me further incentive to study hard and to practice coding as much as I can. Even though this website has many things which I know can be improved on, I am still really pleased with how it's turned out. 

I did hit a roadblock at one point when I was struggling to integrate Eleventy into my code. Initially, a few weeks back, I saw Kevin Powell had a Youtube video tutorial for making a blog page with Eleventy and Netlify CMS, so I thought I would take a look. However, even though I had cloned his repository from Github and was following along with his tutorial, I was still not getting my website to work the same as his. So I gave up (temporarily). 

That's when I decided to work from the ground up, building the HTML and CSS for the blog by myself and styling it the way I wanted. Once that was set up, which took me about three days in total, I returned to the Eleventy tutorial. This time I made sure to Google any issues I was facing and I reminded myself that it is a learning process. Therefore, despite facing issues as you normally do, I stayed committed and managed to eventually get everything up and running. What you have before you is five days of building the structure of my blog, styling it the way I liked, and integrating it with Eleventy and Netlify CMS, so that I can add new articles to my blog effortlessly.
