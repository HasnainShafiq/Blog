A lot of changes have been made to the original site. These include changes to the structure, ccolour theme, and the way the css files are organised. I'm in the process of refactoring my css to make sure that I haven't repeated myself unncessarily and to uphold the DRY principle. I am quite happy with the way the site is turning out. Still got the individual article pages to restyle and I need to add in pagination to the 'blogs' page.
