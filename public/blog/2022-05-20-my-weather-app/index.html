<h4><strong>Intro</strong> <a href="#intro" id="intro"> <strong>#</strong> </a></h4>
<p>Welcome to a short review of my second complete <a href="https://uncreative-creativity.github.io/weather-api/">project</a>. This project was an attempt at demonstrating my back end capabilities, especially since this blog itself was largely focused on the front end. Despite being a relatively simple project which many aspiring junior web developers include as part of their portfolios, it served as a refresher of certain concepts which I had forgotten, given that I hadn't had much practice with the back end. Read on for my review of my take on the classic weather API application.</p>
<h4><strong>What went well</strong> <a href="#what-went-well" id="what-went-well"> <strong>#</strong> </a></h4>
<p>As cliche as it may be, I believe we should always celebrate when we complete any of our goals. Particularly within the tech field, it is all too easy to disband a project before seeing it through to the end, so I am happy that I finished this project, and I did a good job of it.</p>
<p>Moving on to the more technical aspects of the project, I found that I didn't struggle to recall the main concepts revolving around creating a <code>fetch</code> API. I was able to call two API's using <code>fetch</code> and retrieve their data in JSON format. After this, it was simple enough to either select pre-existing HTML elements in the DOM, or to create new DOM elements and assign values to them from the JSON object which was returned from the APIs.</p>
<p>There are a couple other things I am pleased with, too. Sometimes, I fall into the trap of over thinking a solution and making it more complex than needs be. After setting up two basic <code>async</code> functions which called the <a href="https://unsplash.com/developers">Unsplash API</a> and the <a href="https://www.weatherapi.com/">Weather API</a> respectively, I wanted to make it so that the photo retrieved from the Unsplash API was representative of the weather conditions of the city which the user searched for.</p>
<p>Initially, I thought I would have to create multiple <code>if...else</code> conditions which checked the temperature of the city and returned a photo based on the temperature. Using the Unsplash API <code>query</code> request parameter, I would hardcode a weather condition for each if statement, such as 'sunny' for weather above 25Â°C, or 'cold' for temperatures below that. However, this process was arbitrary and too messy.</p>
<p>Then, a random thought occurred to mind. I remembered that the Weather API returns some text describing the weather conditions, so I decided to store the weather condition data in a variable, which would be displayed in the DOM, as well as be used in the <code>query</code> parameter. Therefore, when I call <code>fetch</code> on the Unsplash API, I use a string template literal which looks like <pre><code>await fetch (`https://api.unsplash.com/photos/random?query=${condition}&amp;client_id=MY_API_KEY`)</code></pre><p>
The condition is based on the text returned by the Weather API which means that the photos correspond to the weather conditions for each city.</p>
<p>A smaller victory is that I learnt about the <code>.substring</code> method which allows you to create smaller strings from an existing string. Originally, the Weather API returns the current date as year-month-day. However, I'm not used to this format, so I wanted to change it to day/month/year. After some searching, I came across the <code>.substring</code> method and used it to create <code>day</code>, <code>month</code>, and <code>year</code> variables, which I strung together into the day/month/year format. It's not particularly impressive, but I did learn about the <code>.substring</code> method and put it into use.</p>
<p>Also, I was struggling to shrink the content on smaller screen widths. At around 300px screen width, some of the content was refusing to shrink. So I had to do some more searching and, eventually, I found out that <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36247140/why-dont-flex-items-shrink-past-content-size">flex-items have a default</a> <code>min-width</code> of <code>auto</code>, which means that they do not shrink beyond this value. Overriding this and setting it to <code>min-width: 0;</code> fixed the issue and allowed the content to be displayed on smaller screen widths.</p>
<h4><strong>What I can improve on</strong> <a href="#what-i-can-improve-on" id="what-i-can-improve-on"> <strong>#</strong> </a></h4>
<p>In all honesty, given that this is a basic project with relatively little complexity, I don't think there is much to improve. However, I do have two potential additions I could make:</p>
<ol>
<li>I could add a section which allows you to search for two cities and compare their weather data. However, I will need to research how to call an async function in another async function and use its data.</li>
<li>I could add an autocomplete function which brings up a list of cities as the user is typing.</li>
</ol>
<p>If I make either of these additions, you'll be sure to find an edit to this article. For now though, I am happy with how it has turned out.</p>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong> <a href="#conclusion" id="conclusion"> <strong>#</strong> </a></h4>
<p>Building this weather application was a positive experience. It was a refresher of concepts which I had not put to use since learning them. In particular, it reinforced concepts revolving around using <code>fetch</code>, namely using <code>async/await</code>, handling promises, and accessing data from JSON objects to use in the DOM. While going through tutorials, I didn't see myself making use of the back end as much as the front end, but this experience has shown me a glimpse of the benefits of being able to navigate your way around the back end and manipulate data which you receive from APIs to create a vast range of applications.</p></p>
